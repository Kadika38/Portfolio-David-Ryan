                    Hello!  My name is David Ryan.  Welcome to my portfolio page!

                    I graduated from the UCSD Extension Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp in 2022.  I'm a full stack web developer with deployed projects using tools like React and several different database types.

                    I have experience writing code in JavaScript, Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and SQL as well as a full understanding of OOP.  I have deployed projects using several different databases (SQL, MongoDB, indexedDB, GraphQL) and tools such as Express, Sequelize, and Mongoose.  I have multiple projects built using React.  I worked on a team of 4-5 on 3 projects, two of which are deployed and one of which is showcased in the Portfolio section of this site.  I also have used AWS Lambda functions, AWS API Gateways, and AWS DynamoDB, though none of my deployed projects use these (yet).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of work I enjoy driving, exploring San Diego's restaurants, wineries, and breweries, reading, playing video games, seeing movies, and spending time with friends and family.

                    Peruse my portfolio - if you're interested enough to reach out, email works best.  My email is dryan10101@gmail.com.  My LinkedIn and GitHub are linked to at the bottom of the page.  I'm looking for work!  While I'm specialized in web development, I'm a fast learner and more than open to other coding-based positions. Thanks!
