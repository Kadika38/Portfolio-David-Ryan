## Description

    This project is a portfolio for me.  I wanted to create a template for showcasing my work.
    It was an assignment for my bootcamp, but it's also a really useful tool and a great example of my abilities.
    I also loved the challenge.

    It's a simple design that still showcases my current abilities.
    A nice page with links at the top that scroll to the corresponding portion of the page.
    The main body of the page is two sections: 'About Me' and 'Work'.
    About Me gives some brief info about me to the reader, as well as currently introducing the page as it is.
    The Work section is a set of tiles that represent projects that I'm showcasing here.
    Each tile is a grayed out image with a title and subtitle that stops being grayed out when the mouse hovers over it.
    Two of them currently work, but I only have the two projects.
    The other three tiles are currently placeholders for future projects.
    The bottom of the page has a 'Contact Me' section with my phone number and email address as well as a link to my GitHub.

    P.S. The placeholder links work, to showcase my abilities.
    Since they are just placeholders, they just open a funny image in another tab.
